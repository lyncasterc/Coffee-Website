# Coffee-Website

This is my first attempt at "hand-coding" a full website with multiple pages.
I am creating this website in the style of several local specialty coffee shops near me.

At the time of writing this, I am about one month into learning HTML and CSS. 
This website is sort of a final test for me before I begin to learn JS.
